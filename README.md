- 👋 Hi, I’m @averonese9346 aka Amber Veronese.
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, writing, fitness, dancing, and learning new things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced algorithms and programming for AI. I'm proficient in Python and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! one day I'd love to collab with someone to create 1) a fitness app that seamlessly integrates fitness class enrollment and is compatible with iOS and Google OS and can even import these appointments to your calendar, or 2) work on an algorithm that **actually** parses out information from your resume that is **correct**. The way I see it there are flaws in both systems - MindBody exists for fitness apps but it's not great at all and we all know how resume parsing out goes! I'm still learning, but would love to make my mark with something like that.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me @ averonese9346@gmail.com. 
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite flavor of candy is caramel. And yes, it's pronounced care-uh-mel!
